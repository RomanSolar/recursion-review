# Document your thoughts and process here

[How to use this file](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/content_link/github.com/gSchool/docs.student-wiki/reading/Sprint-Planning.md)

## This is where you improve your process...
-  Collect your thoughts
-  Think step by step
-  Decompose the problem
-  Take notes and write questions for now and later

"What's the smallest thing I can do right now to take one step forward?"

> "...Computer scientists take care to distinguish between “process” and “outcome.” If you followed the best possible process, then you've done all you can, and you shouldn’t blame yourself if things didn’t go your way."
> - Brian Christian, Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions
